## Module Overview

### Purpose
The Services/AIProviders/Implementations module provides concrete implementations of AI provider services, enabling the application to communicate with various AI platforms through a unified interface.

1. **Provider Abstraction**: All implementations follow the same IAIProviderService interface
2. **Error Handling**: Consistent error handling and user feedback across providers
3. **Security**: Secure API key management and HTTPS communication
4. **Reliability**: Timeout handling and graceful degradation
5. **Extensibility**: Easy addition of new AI providers through common patterns

### Implementation Patterns
- **BaseAIService**: Common functionality and interface implementation
- **Provider-Specific Logic**: Each service handles its provider's unique requirements
- **Error Categorization**: Consistent error handling for different failure modes

### Usage Patterns
```csharp
// Service registration (in MauiProgram.cs)
services.AddTransient<DummyAIService>();
services.AddTransient<GroqAIService>();
services.AddTransient<OpenRouterAIService>();
services.AddTransient<AzureAIService>();

// Factory-based creation
var aiService = _aiProviderFactory.CreateProvider("groq");
var response = await aiService.SendChatAsync(chatRequest);

// Direct usage in ChatService
var response = await _currentAIService.SendChatAsync(request);
```
