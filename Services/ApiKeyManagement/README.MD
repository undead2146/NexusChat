**ApiKeyStorageProvider.cs**

*   **Purpose:** Provides API keys from various sources (.env, environment variables, SecureStorage).
*   **Logic & Flow:**
    *   `InitializeAsync`: Loads keys from environment variables (including .env files found in common locations). Prepares for on-demand loading from `SecureStorage`.
    *   `GetApiKeyAsync`: Checks in-memory cache, then environment variables, then `SecureStorage`. Caches successfully retrieved keys.
    *   `SaveProviderApiKeyAsync`/`DeleteProviderApiKeyAsync`: Updates in-memory cache and `SecureStorage`.
    *   `LoadEnvironmentVariables`: Loads .env files and system environment variables matching `API_KEY_PREFIX`.
    *   Obsolete synchronous methods are present and correctly limit their scope to avoid deadlocks.
*   **Design Patterns:** Provider Pattern, Caching.
*   **Architecture:** Abstracts key retrieval. Uses `DotNetEnv` and `SecureStorage`.
*   **Data Flow:** Key name -> API key string.
*   **Naming:** Clear and conventional.
*   **Improvements/Suggestions:**
    *   **Secure Storage Loading:** `LoadSecureStorageKeysAsync` notes that keys are loaded on-demand by `GetApiKeyAsync`. This is an acceptable strategy. The method name might imply a preload, but the comment clarifies.

**ApiKeyManager.cs**

*   **Purpose:** Higher-level management of API keys, building on `IApiKeyStorageProvider`.
*   **Logic & Flow:**
    *   `InitializeAsync`: Initializes `_ApiKeyStorageProvider`, loads .env (redundant if `ApiKeyStorageProvider` also does it, but harmless), caches common keys. Includes retry logic.
    *   `GetApiKeyAsync`: Uses `GetEnvironmentVariableName` for consistent key naming, checks cache, then environment, then `_ApiKeyStorageProvider`.
    *   `SaveProviderApiKeyAsync`: Validates key format, saves via `_ApiKeyStorageProvider`, updates cache, and raises `ApiKeyChanged` event.
    *   `GetModelApiKeyAsync`: Tries model-specific key naming first, then falls back to provider-level key.
    *   `IsValidApiKeyFormat`: Basic regex validation for common API key patterns.
*   **Design Patterns:** Manager/Service Pattern, Caching, Event-based notification.
*   **Architecture:** Facade over `IApiKeyStorageProvider` with added business logic (validation, specific key naming).
*   **Data Flow:** Provider/model name -> API key string, delegating storage.
*   **Naming:** Clear and conventional.
*   **Improvements/Suggestions:**
    *   **Common Keys Caching:** `CacheCommonKeysAsync` uses a hardcoded list of providers.
    *   **Env Loading:** `Env.Load()` is called here and also in `ApiKeyStorageProvider`. While `DotNetEnv.Env.Load()` is generally safe to call multiple times (it usually doesn't reload if already loaded), ensure this doesn't cause unintended side effects or consider centralizing the initial load.
